## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Because python is an interpreted, It has OOPs concept. Human can understand python easily and also it can be used to create a variety of different programs.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?Variables are containers for storing data values.
Variables are containers for storing data values.
x = 7
y = "India"

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
By using input()
name = inpunt("Enter username")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
String

Q8. What is type casting?
Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
No, python user input() function takes only one argument.

Q10. What are keywords?
Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. 
Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.
The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name. 
All the keywords in python are written in lower case except True and False. There are 33 keywords in Python

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No, we cannot use keywords as variable names. Because keywords have predefined meanings.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Using print()

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
/ Division operator. The result is of a floating-point type even if both inputs are integers
// Division operator. The result is of a integer type even if both inputs are float type

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
a='iNeuron'
print(a*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

a= int(input("Enter number" ))
if a%2 ==0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")


Q18. What are boolean operator?

A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
operators are AND, OR, NOT 

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 = 1

0 and 0 =0

True and False and True = False(0)

1 or 0 or 0 = 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program
types if.
	if..else.
	Nested if.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
If-elif-else statement is used in Python for decision-making i.e the program will evaluate test expression and will execute the remaining statements only if the given test expression turns out to be true. This allows validation for multiple expressions

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
age = int(input(" Enter age of a person"))
if age>= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum+=i
print(sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

x= int(input("Enter no"))
y= int(input("Enter no"))
z= int(input("Enter no"))

if x>y and x>z:
    print("Greatest no is ",x)
elif y>z:
    print("Greatest no is ",y)
else:
    print("Greatest no is ",z)


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i % 5==0 and i <= 150:
        print(i)
    elif i > 500:
        break

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

String is array of sequenced characters and is written inside single quotes, double quotes or triple quotes
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. 'hello' is the same as "hello".

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [] .

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string[9::]
print("desired_output =",desired_output)

Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "norueNi"

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string[-1:-8:-1]
print("desired_output =",desired_output)

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[::-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?

Python will not allow deleting a particular character in a string. Whereas you can remove the entire string variable using the del command.

Q32. What is escape sequence?

An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, 
does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters.

Q33. How can you print the below string?
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

print("'iNeuron's Big Data Course'")

Q34. What is a list in Python?

A Python list is an ordered and changeable collection of data objects. 
Unlike an array, which can contain objects of a single type, a list can contain a mixture of objects.

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?

To create a list in Python, we use square brackets ( [] ). 
Here's what a list looks like: ListName = [ListItem, ListItem1, ListItem2, ListItem3, ...]

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.


Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]

print(lst[4][2])

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.

input_string = input("Enter a list element separated by space ")
list  = input_string.split()
print(len(list))

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst[3] = "Big"
print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements of different data types, such as integer, float, string, list or even a tuple.
Elements of a tuple are enclosed in parenthesis (round brackets) and are separated by commas
List and Tuple in Python are the classes of Python Data Structures. The list is dynamic, whereas the tuple has static characteristics. 
This means that lists can be modified whereas tuples cannot be modified, the tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses () , separated by commas.
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
new_tuple = my_tuple + ('ada',)
print(new_tuple)

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
You can't add elements to a tuple because of their immutable property. 
There's no append() or extend() method for tuples, You can't remove elements from a tuple, also because of their immutability.

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
# Get tuple input from the user
input_tuple = tuple(input("Enter elements of the tuple separated by space: ").split())
# Get the count of elements in the tuple
count = len(input_tuple)
# Print the count of elements
print("The count of elements in the tuple is:", count)

Q45. What are sets in Python?
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created.
Sets are similar to lists and tuples in Python, but they have some important differences:
Sets are unordered, which means that you cannot rely on the order of elements in a set.
Sets can only contain unique elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.
Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created.

Q46. How can you create a set?
can create a set using either curly braces {} or the set() constructor. 

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
# Adding "iNeuron" to the set
my_set.add("iNeuron")
# Printing the set
print(my_set)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
prime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}
# add 11 to prime_numbers
prime_numbers.add(11)
print(prime_numbers)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
add() - It accepts an element as an argument and if that element is not already present in the set, then it adds that to the set.
update() - It expects a single or multiple iterable sequences as arguments and appends all the elements in these iterable sequences to the set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
the clear() method is used to remove all elements from a set. The method does not take any arguments and simply removes all elements from the set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
frozen set is an immutable version of the set data type. 
This means that once a frozen set is created, its elements cannot be modified. Frozen sets are created using the frozenset() function.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
 the main difference between a frozen set and a regular set is that a frozen set is immutable, while a regular set is mutable.
 This means that once a frozen set is created, its elements cannot be modified, while a regular set can be modified by adding or removing elements.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
 the union() method is used to return a new set that contains all the elements from two or more sets. 
The method does not modify any of the original sets, but instead returns a new set that contains all the unique elements from all the sets.
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Taking the union of the two sets using union() method
union_set = set1.union(set2)
# Printing the union set
print(union_set)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
the intersection() method is used to return a new set that contains only the elements that are common to two or more sets.
The method does not modify any of the original sets, but instead returns a new set that contains only the elements that are present in all the sets.
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Taking the intersection of the two sets using intersection() method
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
# Printing the intersection set
print(intersection_set)

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?
a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. 
Dictionaries are also sometimes called "maps", "hash maps", or "associative arrays" in other programming languages.
Dictionary elements are enclosed in curly braces { }, and each key-value pair is separated by a colon : ,

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
Dictionaries in Python are different from other data structures in several ways:
Unlike lists, tuples, and sets, dictionaries are not ordered. This means that the elements in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order.
Dictionaries are key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. This makes dictionaries very useful for mapping one set of values to another.
Dictionaries are mutable, meaning that you can add or remove key-value pairs or modify the values associated with existing keys.
Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, which means that they are optimized for fast access and retrieval of values by key. This makes dictionaries very efficient for large data sets.
Dictionaries are very flexible, and can store any type of data as keys or values, including other data structures like lists, tuples, and even other dictionaries.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
Declare a dictionary using curly braces {} and separating each key-value pair with a colon :
my_dict = {}
my_dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}

Q58. What will the output of the following?
var = {}
print(type(var))
output : <class 'dict'>

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?
my_dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}
# Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary
my_dict["pear"] = 4
# Update the value for an existing key
my_dict["apple"] = 5
print(my_dict)  

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
my_dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}
# Iterate over the values of the dictionary
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)
 
Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
my_dict = {"fruits": {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}, "vegetables": {"carrot": 4, "broccoli": 5, "celery": 6}}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}:")
    for inner_key, inner_value in value.items():
        print(f"   {inner_key}: {inner_value}")

Q62. What is the use of get() function?
The get() function is a method that is used to retrieve the value of a key in a dictionary. It takes one required argument, 
which is the key to retrieve the value of, and an optional default value argument, which is returned if the key is not present in the dictionary.

Q63. What is the use of items() function?
The items() function is a method that can be used with dictionaries in Python. 
It returns a view object that contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.
The items() function is useful when we want to iterate over all the key-value pairs in a dictionary.
We can use a for loop to iterate over the view object and unpack the tuples into separate variables for the key and value.
