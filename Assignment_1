## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Because python is an interpreted, It has OOPs concept. Human can understand python easily and also it can be used to create a variety of different programs.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Pros:
Python is easy to learn and read
Python enhances productivity
Python has a vast collection of librarie
Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
Python is a portable programming language
Python is an interpreted language
	
Cons:
Python has speed limitations
Python is not so strong with mobile computing
Python can have runtime errors
Python consumes a lot of memory space

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Machine learning / Artificial intelligence.
Desktop GUI.
Data analytics and data visualization.Web development.
Game development.
Mobiles app development.
Embedded systems.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?Variables are containers for storing data values.
Variables are containers for storing data values.
x = 7
y = "India"

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
By using input()
name = inpunt("Enter username")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
String

Q8. What is type casting?
Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
No, python user input() function takes only one argument.

Q10. What are keywords?
Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. 
Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.
The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name. 
All the keywords in python are written in lower case except True and False. There are 33 keywords in Python

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No, we cannot use keywords as variable names. Because keywords have predefined meanings.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Using print()

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
/ Division operator. The result is of a floating-point type even if both inputs are integers
// Division operator. The result is of a integer type even if both inputs are float type

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
a='iNeuron'
print(a*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

a= int(input("Enter number" ))
if a%2 ==0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")


Q18. What are boolean operator?

A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
operators are AND, OR, NOT 

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 = 1

0 and 0 =0

True and False and True = False(0)

1 or 0 or 0 = 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program
types if.
	if..else.
	Nested if.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
If-elif-else statement is used in Python for decision-making i.e the program will evaluate test expression and will execute the remaining statements only if the given test expression turns out to be true. This allows validation for multiple expressions

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
age = int(input(" Enter age of a person"))
if age>= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum+=i
print(sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

x= int(input("Enter no"))
y= int(input("Enter no"))
z= int(input("Enter no"))

if x>y and x>z:
    print("Greatest no is ",x)
elif y>z:
    print("Greatest no is ",y)
else:
    print("Greatest no is ",z)


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i % 5==0 and i <= 150:
        print(i)
    elif i > 500:
        break

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

String is array of sequenced characters and is written inside single quotes, double quotes or triple quotes
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. 'hello' is the same as "hello".

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [] .

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string[9::]
print("desired_output =",desired_output)

Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "norueNi"

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string[-1:-8:-1]
print("desired_output =",desired_output)

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[::-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?

Python will not allow deleting a particular character in a string. Whereas you can remove the entire string variable using the del command.

Q32. What is escape sequence?

An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, 
does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters.

Q33. How can you print the below string?
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

print("'iNeuron's Big Data Course'")

Q34. What is a list in Python?

A Python list is an ordered and changeable collection of data objects. 
Unlike an array, which can contain objects of a single type, a list can contain a mixture of objects.

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?

To create a list in Python, we use square brackets ( [] ). 
Here's what a list looks like: ListName = [ListItem, ListItem1, ListItem2, ListItem3, ...]

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.


Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]

print(lst[4][2])

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.

input_string = input("Enter a list element separated by space ")
list  = input_string.split()
print(len(list))

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst[3] = "Big"
print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements of different data types, such as integer, float, string, list or even a tuple.
Elements of a tuple are enclosed in parenthesis (round brackets) and are separated by commas
List and Tuple in Python are the classes of Python Data Structures. The list is dynamic, whereas the tuple has static characteristics. 
This means that lists can be modified whereas tuples cannot be modified, the tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses () , separated by commas.
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
